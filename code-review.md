# Code Review Guidelines

Code reviews are important, not only to ensure code quality, but also so project team members can learn from each
other. To get the most out of the process, code authors should voice their expectations
of a review, and reviewers should state the performed actions and areas of
focus.

The necessary prerequisite for a *line-by-line* review is that code authors
make sure that the changes they propose actually make sense and the unit and
integration tests pass. *It is still okay to request feedback on work in
progress, but especially then it is important to be explicit about the depth of
the desired review.*

__As code author (pre-review):__

1. Make sure your proposed change does what you think it should do. This also
   means that it conforms to the [code
   style](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/code-style-guidelines), tests
   pass, etc. *Do not waste the reviewer's time with things you can easily get
   right in the first place!*

1. Send a PR that follows our [PR
   guideline](commits.md#pull-request-guidelines-wip), and describe what you
   think are the aspects that require the largest share of a reviewer's
   attention:
   > "Please do / look for / look at the following: ...."

1. Suggest the review to someone, e.g. by using [GitHub's *review
   request*](https://help.github.com/en/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review)
   feature, or by leaving a comment on the *pull request* page, mentioning the
   desired
   [`@<reviewer>`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams).
   Don't be afraid to send a reminder after a couple of
   days if no one has addressed your request.


__As code reviewer:__

1. State your intent, e.g. by using [GitHub's
   *self-assign*](https://help.github.com/en/articles/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users)
   feature, or by leaving a comment on the *pull request* page.

1. [Perform the
   review](https://help.github.com/en/articles/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request).
   Try to catch mistakes that might have slipped through automated testing,
   e.g. if a docs PR adds URLs, check if they actually resolve, etc.
   Be diligent, but also remember that the goal is not to demonstrate your
   review skills but to integrate the proposed bug fix or feature. And be
   respectful in word choice and tone.

1. Mention the areas (topical, regional) you focused on. Feel free to mention
   areas you cannot review as well:
   > "Here's what I did to review your code: ...."


__As code author (post-review):__

1. Address **all (!)** review comments. *Do not waste the reviewer's time by
   forcing them to leave the same comment twice!*

    - Reply to the comment if it is unclear or you think the reviewer got
      something wrong.

    - Otherwise, push new commits that address the comment. These commits
      follow the same [guidelines as regular commits](commits.md). Also see
      notes about [rebasing in an open *pull request*](git-history.md).

1. Start over with *"As code author (pre-review)"* above...
